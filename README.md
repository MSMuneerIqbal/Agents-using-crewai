**Agentic AI Using CrewAI: Project Overview**

CrewAI is an innovative open-source Python framework designed to facilitate the development of collaborative, autonomous AI agents that work together to solve complex problems. Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of its features, components, and practical applications:

### **Key Features of CrewAI**
- **Multi-Agent System**: CrewAI allows the creation of multiple AI agents, each with specialized roles, to collaboratively tackle tasks.
- **Task Decomposition**: Complex problems can be broken down into manageable tasks, which are then assigned to different agents.
- **Manager Agent**: A central agent that oversees the workflow, monitors progress, and coordinates the interactions between agents.
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Agents can dynamically adjust their strategies based on feedback and changing conditions.

### **Components of CrewAI**
1. **Agents**: Individual AI entities that specialize in specific tasks. Examples include:
   - **Code Reader**: Analyzes code.
   - **Code Reviewer**: Reviews and suggests improvements.
   - **Code Documentation Writer**: Generates documentation based on code analysis.
   - **CV Reader**: Processes CV data.
   - **Query Builder**: Constructs database queries.
   - **Query Executor**: Executes the constructed queries.

2. **Tasks**: Defined units of work that agents are responsible for completing.

3. **Crew**: A collection of agents working together to accomplish a set of tasks.

## Main Function Points

- **Multi-Agent System**: The project allows the creation of multiple AI agents, each with specialized roles, to collaboratively tackle tasks.
- **Task Decomposition**: Complex problems can be broken down into manageable tasks, which are then assigned to different agents.
- **Manager Agent**: A central agent that oversees the workflow, monitors progress, and coordinates the interactions between agents.
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Agents can dynamically adjust their strategies based on feedback and changing conditions.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**
- **CrewAI framework**

### **How CrewAI Works**
- Agents communicate with each other to share insights and data.
- The Manager Agent coordinates these efforts, ensuring that each agent‚Äôs output feeds correctly into the next agent‚Äôs input.
- This collaborative approach allows the system to handle complex tasks efficiently.

### **Use Cases**
CrewAI has been applied in various projects, including:
- **Terraform Code Analysis**: A workflow involving a Code Reader, Code Reviewer, and Code Documentation Writer to automate code review and documentation generation.
- **CV Data Transformation**: A project that converts unstructured CV text into structured data for databases, utilizing agents specialized in reading CVs and executing queries.

## ‚ö° PowerShell Setup  
To begin, run the following command to install UV:  
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```
Check if UV is installed correctly:  
```sh
uv version
uv help
```

---

## üéØ UV Basics
Initialize a new project:  
```sh
uv init my-project
code .
```
Open the terminal and navigate into the project folder:  
```sh
cd .\my-project\
uv run hello.py
```
Modify `hello.py`, rerun the script, and observe changes:  
```sh
uv run hello.py
```

---

## üì¶ Adding Dependencies  
Install additional packages:  
```sh
uv add numpy pandas
```
Verify the dependencies in the `pyproject.toml` file.  

---

## üöÄ Creating and Managing Projects  
Create another project:  
```sh
uv init --package another-project
```
Return to VS Code and check the `pyproject.toml` file.  
Navigate to `src/` and create `hello.py`:
```python
def my_function():
    print("Hello from my_function()")
```
Now, add a new command in `pyproject.toml`:  
```toml
gloprog = "another_project.hello:my_function"
```
Run the command from the terminal:  
```sh
uv run gloprog
```
Install the package in editable mode:  
```sh
pip install -e .
```

---

## üî• Working with LiteLLM  
Initialize a new project:  
```sh
uv init --package litellm-project
cd litellm-project
```
Add the LiteLLM dependency:  
```sh
uv add litellm
uv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:  
```sh
.venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
```
Now make hello.py in SRC folder. 

```python
from litellm import completion
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "ADD YOUR API KEY"
os.environ["GEMINI_API_KEY"] = "ADD YOUR API KEY"

def openai():
    response = completion(
        model="openai/gpt-4o",
        messages=[{"content": "Hello, how are you?", "role": "user"}]
    )
    print(response)

def gemini():
    response = completion(
        model="gemini/gemini-1.5-flash",
        messages=[{"content": "Hello, how are you?", "role": "user"}]
    )
    print(response)

def gemini2():
    response = completion(
        model="gemini/gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
        messages=[{"content": "Hello, how are you?", "role": "user"}]
    )
    print(response)
```
Add your API key and run:  
```sh
uv run gemini
```

## üß† Understanding Python Decorators  
**Python decorators** are functions that modify the behavior of another function without changing its structure.  
Example:  
```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("After the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, world!")

say_hello()
```
Try running this in **Google Colab** to experiment with decorators.
