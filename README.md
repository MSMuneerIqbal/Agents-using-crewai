**Agentic AI Using CrewAI: Project Overview**

CrewAI is an innovative open-source Python framework designed to facilitate the development of collaborative, autonomous AI agents that work together to solve complex problems. Here’s a detailed breakdown of its features, components, and practical applications:

### **Key Features of CrewAI**
- **Multi-Agent System**: CrewAI allows the creation of multiple AI agents, each with specialized roles, to collaboratively tackle tasks.
- **Task Decomposition**: Complex problems can be broken down into manageable tasks, which are then assigned to different agents.
- **Manager Agent**: A central agent that oversees the workflow, monitors progress, and coordinates the interactions between agents.
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Agents can dynamically adjust their strategies based on feedback and changing conditions.

### **Components of CrewAI**
1. **Agents**: Individual AI entities that specialize in specific tasks. Examples include:
   - **Code Reader**: Analyzes code.
   - **Code Reviewer**: Reviews and suggests improvements.
   - **Code Documentation Writer**: Generates documentation based on code analysis.
   - **CV Reader**: Processes CV data.
   - **Query Builder**: Constructs database queries.
   - **Query Executor**: Executes the constructed queries.

2. **Tasks**: Defined units of work that agents are responsible for completing.

3. **Crew**: A collection of agents working together to accomplish a set of tasks.

### **How CrewAI Works**
- Agents communicate with each other to share insights and data.
- The Manager Agent coordinates these efforts, ensuring that each agent’s output feeds correctly into the next agent’s input.
- This collaborative approach allows the system to handle complex tasks efficiently.

### **Use Cases**
CrewAI has been applied in various projects, including:
- **Terraform Code Analysis**: A workflow involving a Code Reader, Code Reviewer, and Code Documentation Writer to automate code review and documentation generation.
- **CV Data Transformation**: A project that converts unstructured CV text into structured data for databases, utilizing agents specialized in reading CVs and executing queries.

### **Example Code Implementation**
Here’s a simple example of how to set up a CrewAI project with agents and tasks:

```python
import os
from getpass import getpass
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process

# Set up API keys securely
SERPER_API_KEY = getpass("Your Serper API key")
os.environ['SERPER_API_KEY'] = SERPER_API_KEY
GROQ_API_KEY = getpass("Your Groq API key")
os.environ['GROQ_API_KEY'] = GROQ_API_KEY

# Define agents
code_reader = Agent(role="Code Reader", goal="Read and analyze code.")
code_reviewer = Agent(role="Code Reviewer", goal="Review code and suggest improvements.")
doc_writer = Agent(role="Documentation Writer", goal="Generate documentation from code analysis.")

# Define tasks
read_task = Task(name="Read Code", agent=code_reader)
review_task = Task(name="Review Code", agent=code_reviewer)
write_task = Task(name="Write Documentation", agent=doc_writer)

# Create a Crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[code_reader, code_reviewer, doc_writer],
    tasks=[read_task, review_task, write_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    max_rpm=3,
    cache=True
)

# Execute the Crew
result = crew.kickoff(inputs={'code_base': "path/to/code"})
print(result)
